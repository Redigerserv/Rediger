                        <p>Company incorporation is the process of setting up a business entity in accordance with the laws of the country. It involves registering a company name, obtaining necessary licenses and permits, and filing documents with the relevant government agencies. Once a company is incorporated, it must comply with all post-incorporation compliances and statutory registrations to remain in good standing. One such compliance is Professional Tax Registration (PT). This registration is typically required for companies that employ people in India, as it requires them to deduct professional tax from their employees' salaries and deposit it with the government authorities. By registering for PT, companies can ensure that they are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
